  Exercise 8.3: Many people argue that repeat--until is seldom used, and
  therefore it should not be present in a minimalistic language like Lua. What
  do you think?

  - I think repeat statement has its use and since it doesn't add much to
    complexity or size of Lua compiler I would certainly keep it. With or
    without that statement Lua is still minimalistic which I like. In fact
    I would also prefer a switch statement as it is often needed.
