Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
     To the Pean of the bells —
          Of the bells: — 
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
     To the throbbing of the bells — 
Of the bells, bells, bells — 
     To the sobbing of the bells: — 
Keeping time, time, time,
     As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy Runic rhyme,
     To the rolling of the bells —
Of the bells, bells, bells: — 
     To the tolling of the bells — 
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
     Bells, bells, bells — 
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
